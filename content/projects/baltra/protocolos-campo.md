 **1.	All treatments receive equal amounts of water at the time of planting.** This is important for ensuring that we can accurately gauge the effect of water-saving technology and separate it from the effect of just adding more water. All water must be measured using pre-marked buckets to ensure equal water is used.

 **2.	Plantings will not receive any more water or physical attention after planting other than taking monitoring measurements.** This is important for ensuring that our results match with the protocols that are likely to be used by the GNPD. For example, it is very unlikely that the national park will have the resources to visit and clean every water-saving technology or add water after planting. For that reason, we should collect data using the same protocol. This includes no cleaning or ‘fixing’ Groasis waterboxxes if pieces come loose, etc. The only exception is if a hole in the technology provides any possible threat to birds or other wildlife, in which case it can be fixed (for example, if the watering hole is open). Additionally, regular care and maintenance is not always feasible in the case of large-scale remote restoration work, so our results must be directly applicable to those end goals.

 **3.	Several data points (in addition to normal monitoring) must be recorded during monitoring:**
+ The state of the technology should be recorded: is the lid still on, is it missing, are any parts loose or missing? This is important for recording and understanding the long-term effectiveness and functionality (and potential plastic garbage contamination) of the technologies. For example, how many plastic parts from the technologies are expected to get lost and ‘pollute’ during large-scale restoration. This is an important ‘cost’ that must be taken into account.

+ Each planting expedition needs to record all costs by category, number of days/hours, and number of field staff with roles. This is critical for getting a realistic and accurate cost estimate for scaling restoration efforts beyond our work. By recording these data in detail for each expedition, we can better separate and remove the time and resources required for our monitoring (which is not included when restoration is actually implemented).

+ The date when Groasis Waterboxx is removed from each individual plant must be recorded. This is essential for providing a suggested time-table for each species on Baltra Island.

+ The age of each seedling at the time of planting must be recorded in case there are any effects of seedling age on later survival. Seedlings can be labeled before taken to the field and then their age is added to the datasheet when doing the initial monitoring.

 **4.	All plantings must be randomly stratified with a balanced treatment design within each site.** In other words, all plantings are located randomly with respect to treatment and species, and there is maintained a balanced number of treatments within each site (e.g., one site does not have more controls than another site). Randomizing locations can be achieved by pre-labeling flags with species and treatment and placing them haphazardly within a site. Ensuring a balanced design for each site can be done when labeling flags before placement. Similarly, it is important that treatments and species are planted in a random progression. For example, do not the controls or Groasis or a certain species for separate days. There are several reasons for this, but for example if work needs to end early, then the experimental planting will still remain more or less balanced. It will also ensure that certain species or treatments do not receive subconscious preferential treatment.

 **5. Plantings will follow the overall experimental design for sample sizes, but also follow
guidelines for minimum sample sizes required for each individual planting
expedition.** This is important for ensuring reliable results. For example, it is important to
plant a minimum of six plants with each treatment in one planting expedition than to
plant only one or two plants (Tables 1 and 2).

 **6 This experiment can be divided into stages: Stage one will be considered complete
once all species are planted with these protocols and reach the required minimum sample
sizes.** Stage two will be complete and initial results can be analyzed once two years have
passed since stage one was complete. Stage three will be complete once 10 years have
passed since stage one was complete or several years have passed since all Groasis
Waterboxxes have been removed from surviving individuals.

 **7. Plantings for this experiment should be monitored a minimum of every four months
until stage two is complete, and then every six months thereafter (twice per year).**
This will be important for acquiring sufficient data.

 **8. When allocating resources and time towards germinating and growing seedlings for
outplanting, priority should be given first to the most abundant species and
functional groups (Figure 2, Table 1).** The reason for this is that those species or groups
will have the biggest costs when scaling restoration since they are most abundant and
those species are a priority for evaluation.

 **9. Not all treatments are used with all species in this design in cases where existing
results strongly suggest that those technologies are not likely to provide any
improvement or value.** For example, hydrogel was excluded from most species because
of its general negative effect.

 **10. Results thus far suggest that the best survival has been achieved by planting
between the months of June and October.** Planting expeditions should be encouraged
during this period, but the results are preliminary and this is not a strong rule.

 **11. Once overall sample sizes are reached for each species, no further resources are
required for planting or germinating more of those species.** It will be better to
allocated our limited time and resources towards ensuring a complete sample size of all
species in this experiment rather than planting many additional individuals of a species
for which we already have sufficient data. In cases where we already have too many
seedlings for a particular species, it is important that we establish collaborations with
DPNG and other organizations who can plant our additional seedlings using our current
best findings. This will be necessary later anyway, so better to begin with these
collaboration
